###CC90HFE

<b>CC90</b> is a 38400 baud serial transfer program (about 4ko every second) between today computers and the Thomson. To make it work right, you need some material :

* An USB/RS232 adapter (or USB-Serial) you could find it in the shops or on the Internet. Choose a Prolific PL2303 chipset, whose technology is compatible with most of platforms.
* A CC90-232 interface, that you already have or you will find on the Internet, and that you will have to modify.
* A DB25/DB9 adapter fully wired (no 'null modem'!).

The little electronic modification won't alter your interface faculties.
