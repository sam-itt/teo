######Why choosing the CC90-232 interface ? There is an interface compatible with Thomsons of last generation, isn't it ?
Yes, there is an interface which works with TO8, TO8D and TO9+ : the RF57-932 interface. But it's hard to find it.

######Is it possible to use the RF57-932 interface with CC90 program ?
No. Hardware registers are not similar. CC90 program won't then work.

######Why a 38400 baud speed ?
We could choose a higher speed, like 57600 baud, for example. First, a 6809 cycle can't be divided, and a 57600 baud speed need a temporization of 17.333 cycles. Next, a slower speed gives the opportunity to calculate the CRC during  the transmission, and to be more comfortable in loops.
