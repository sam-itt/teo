###Additional informations about Teo  MS-DOS/DPMI

#####Installation<a name="install"></a>

To run the emulator, you need at least a 80386 with 2MB of RAM, a VGA card, and MS-DOS version 5.0 or greater or Windows version 3.1 or greater (Windows 95/98/Me). A Sound Blaster compatible sound-card is necessary to emulate sound.
To install the emulator, you just have to unzip *`teo-1.8.1-dosexe.zip`*. The executable will be *`teo.exe`*.
The file *`cwsdpmi.exe`* is only useful for running in protected mode under MS-DOS.

#####Lauching<a name="launch"></a>

When the program is stated, headers and initialization messages are printed, then the user is asked to choose a graphic mode if it hasn't been specified on the command-line. Then the emulation starts.
TEO accepts the following parameters on the command line:

<table border="1" width="100%">
<tr><td>[-help]</td><td>Prints on-line help</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-nojoy]</td><td>do not use native PC joysticks</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-mode40]</td><td>starts the emulator in 40 columns, 16 colors and full-screen mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-mode80]</td><td>starts the emulator in 80 columns, 16 colors and full-screen mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-truecolor]</td><td>starts the emulator in 80 columns, 4096 colors and full-screen mode</td></tr>
</table>

Note that you can also load the last saved emulator state by pressing the left or right CTRL key while choosing the graphic mode.

#####Graphic modes<a name="gfx_modes"></a>

Teo can use the graphical modes 320x200x8 VGA, 640x400x8 VESA and 640x400x16 VESA.

If VESA modes aren't available on your graphic board, you can use the utility SciTech Display Doctor (previously known as UniVBE) from <a href="http://www.scitechsoft.com">SciTech Software</a> to help correcting the problem.

#####Joystick<a name="joysticks"></a>

Teo uses available PC joysticks to emulate both TO8 joysticks. When there aren't enough PC joysticks, the missing joystick(s) is (are) emulated using the keyboard.

#####Sound generator<a name="sound_generator"></a>

The TO8 sound is emulated using the sound-card of the PC. Both the 1-bit (TO7) and the 6-bits (Music and games interface) generators are emulated.
Any compatible SoundBlaster card is supported, as well as few other cards (Ensoniq Soundscape, ESS AudioDrive et Windows Sound System).

#####Commands and Settings

It is possible to save and load "images" that contain the state of the emulator at a time. These images are somehow snapshots of a running TO8 and allow the emulator to restart in a previously saved state. However, as the image only contains the internal state of the emulator, external peripheral devices (floppy drives, etc) are not handled.
