###Additional informations about Teo Windows/DirectX

#####Installation
To run the emulator, you need at least a 80486 with 8MB of RAM running under Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows %e, Windows NT4, Windows 2000 or Windows XP. The redistributable component DirectX version 3.0 or higher must be installed. A DirectSound compatible card is required to emulate sound.

You can install the emulator in two ways:

* Launch *`teow-1.8.1-setup.exe`*.
* Unzip *`teo-1.8.1-winexe.zip`*. The executable is named *`teow.exe`*.

#####Launching

TEO accepts the following parameters on the command line:

<table border="1" width="100%">
<tr><td>[-nojoy]</td><td>does not use native PC joysticks</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-mode40]</td><td>starts the emulator in 40 columns, 16 colors and full-screen mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-mode80]</td><td>starts the emulator in 80 columns, 16 colors and full-screen mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-truecolor]</td><td>starts the emulator in 80 columns, 4096 colors and full-screen mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-window]</td><td>starts the emulator in 80 columns, 4096 colors and windowed mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>[xxxxx]</td><td>loads SAP, K7, M7 file(s)</td></tr>
</table>

Please note that you can also load the last saved emulator state by pressing the left or right CTRL key while choosing the graphic mode.

#####Joysticks

Teo uses available PC joysticks to emulate both TO8 joysticks. When there aren't enough PC joysticks, the missing joystick(s) is (are) emulated using the keyboard.

#####Sound generator

Teo uses the default sound peripheral (via DirectSound).

#####Images

It is possible to save and load "images" that contain the state of the emulator at a time. These images are somehow snapshots of a running TO8 and allow the emulator to restart in a previously saved state. However, as the image only contains the internal state of the emulator, external peripheral devices (floppy drives, etc) are not handled.
