#####Installation<a name="installation"></a>

To run the emulator, you need at least a 80486 with 8MB of RAM running under Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Millenium edition, Windows NT4, Windows 2000 or Windows XP. The redistributable component DirectX version 3.0 or higher must be installed. A DirectSound compatible card is required to emulate sound.

You can install the emulator in two ways:

* Launch *`teow-1.8.1-setup.exe`*.
* Unzip *`teo-1.8.1-winexe.zip`*. The executable is named *`teow.exe`*.

#####Launching<a name="launching"></a>

TEO accepts the following parameters on the command line:

<table border="1" width="100%">
<tr><td>[-nojoy]</td><td>does not use native PC joysticks</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-mode40]</td><td>starts the emulator in 40 columns, 16 colors and full-screen mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-mode80]</td><td>starts the emulator in 80 columns, 16 colors and full-screen mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-truecolor]</td><td>starts the emulator in 80 columns, 4096 colors and full-screen mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>[-window]</td><td>starts the emulator in 80 columns, 4096 colors and windowed mode</td></tr>
<tr><td>[xxxxx]</td><td>loads SAP, K7, M7 file(s)</td></tr>
</table>

Please note that you can also load the last saved emulator state by pressing the left or right CTRL key while choosing the graphic mode.

#####Joysticks<a name="joysticks"></a>

Teo uses available PC joysticks to emulate both TO8 joysticks. When there aren't enough PC joysticks, the missing joystick(s) is (are) emulated using the keyboard.

#####Sound generator<a name="sound"></a>

Teo uses the default sound peripheral (via DirectSound).

#####Images<a name="images"></a>

It is possible to save and load "images" that contain the state of the emulator at a time. These images are somehow snapshots of a running TO8 and allow the emulator to restart in a previously saved state. However, as the image only contains the internal state of the emulator, external peripheral devices (floppy drives, etc) are not handled.
