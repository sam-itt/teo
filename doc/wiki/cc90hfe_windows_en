###Use of CC90HFE under Windows

Normally, the serial port is automatically detected by CC90HFE. But if this is not the case, you can still force the name of the serial port in the cc90hfe.ini file - that will be created after running and quitting CC90HFE - in *`teo`* directory facing the *`port_name`* key in the *`[serial]`* section.

#####Using the command line

Use the program *`cc90hfe-com.exe`* or *`bin/cc90hfe.exe`* of the application root directory. Use the option '-h' or '- help' to display the help.

#####Uninstall

If the installation was done with the *`zip`* file, simply remove *`cc90hfe`* root directory.

If the installation was done with the setup file, use the automatic uninstall in the program menu.
