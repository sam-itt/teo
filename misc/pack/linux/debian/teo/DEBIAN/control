Description: Teo, a thomson TO8D microcomputer emulator
 Teo is an emulator of the Thomson TO8 microcomputer for PC, running on MSDOS,
 Windows and Linux.
 .
 The compatibility is close to 100% for softwares which don't use non
 emulated peripherals and don't hold physical protections. In other words,
 if a software doesn't work on Teo, so probably :
 .
 1. it needs the presence of another peripheral than mouse, light-pen,
    joystick, tape recorder and disks (so it won't run as long as this
    peripheral is not emulated),
 .
 2. its physical protection makes it fail.
